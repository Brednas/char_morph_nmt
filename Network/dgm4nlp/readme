This code base is about deep generative models for NLP.


# Install

We develop in `python3` and we like to use `virtualenv`:


* Creating a virtual environment based on python3: this you only need to do the first time.
```sh
virtualenv -p python3 ~/envs/dgm4nlp
```

* Sourcing it: this you need to do whenever you want to run (or develop) the code.
```sh
source ~/envs/dgm4nlp/bin/activate
```

* In case you use `PyCharm` you will need to configure it to use your environment:        
```sh
# navigate to
PyCharm/Preferences/Project/Project Interpreter
# point your interpreter to
~/envs/dgm4nlp/bin/python
```

* Requirements
```sh
# yolk3k is not a requirement, but it is helpful to list packages in our virtual environment
pip install yolk3k
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install cython
pip install Theano
pip install tabulate
# we use the most recent Keras (aka Keras-2)
pip install keras
```
      
* Clone the code
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wilkeraziz/dgm4nlp.git
```
        
* Build
```sh
cd dgm4nlp
python setup.py develop
```
